                        <p>Just another internet user :)</p>
                        <p>My journey here</p>
                        <p>
                            I started when I was 9 or 10, give or take. My only access to the internet was a home
                            laptop my mother had fashioned for me and my sister. She installed some desktop games
                            that we would play ocasionally (I also used to play CS: Source in my uncle's laptop 
                            when he would visit), though I was busier surfing through the web. There I'd begin all
                            the journeys that I plan to document here on this page because web design fun! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I don't think I ever got to experience Web 1.0 back in its hayday given I wasn't even
                            a concept in the 90's, but I did get to experience all the changes many of my favorite 
                            websites went through from late 2000's to now, both design and corporate-decisions-wise, 
                            both good and questionable (mostly questionable). My opinion is simple:
                        </p>
                        <h3> WEB 3.0 <span class="censor-span"> FUCKING</span> SUCKS </h3>
                        <p>
                            If you're like me before deciding on this personal project then you have an undiscovered
                            feeling that all of the web feels... void. Remember how it felt like to log into a site
                            like YouTube fifteen years ago (2010)? Or, if you're even more like me, what about logging 
                            in the social games you'd play like Habbo or Club Penguin, and going on your virtual
                            shenanigans with your virtual friends? Yeah, they don't make sites like those anymore.
                            I'm glad atleast Roblox has survived, but the form its taken is ugly. Not just sentimentally,
                            the UI is just nothing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Modern sites transmit nothing. Modern web transmits nothing.
                            And it makes me a little sad, it makes me feel like the web I experienced is gone. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anyway, all those sentiments and more bring me here. As I'm writing, I'm a bit of a
                            newbie in programming, though I just managed to dual-boot my laptop and am currently
                            in my Ubuntu OS (holy maccaroni it's crazy how much faster this is than my Windows 11 
                            part). That is to say, I am taking up on a lot of personal programming-related projects 
                            while I'm on summer break. So, stick around! Find out a bit about me! I'll be adding
                            stuff as I go, y'know, the usual personal page tid bits I guess.
